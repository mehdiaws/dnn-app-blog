# dnn-app-blog
This repo contains files for the following AWS blog: "Creating an end-to-end application for orchestrating custom deep learning HPO, training, and inference using AWS Step Functions"

# Overview of components

This application consists of 4 main components, separated into 4 folders:
1. `machine-learning` - contains SageMaker notebook and scripts for building ML Docker Image (for both HPO and training a new model)
2. `shared-infra` - contains AWS resources used by both `backend` and `frontend` in CloudFormation template.
3. `backend` - contains backend code, APIs, a pipeline for retraining model and running HPO, and database (DynamoDB) 
4. `frontend` - contains web application code. The web application connected to the deployment of `backend` folder

# Prerequisite
1. On the account you want to deploy, create a new case by going to [Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home?region=us-east-1#/) and click the orange "Create case" button
    1. Select "Service limit increase" checkbox
    2. Under "Case details" > "Limit type" > select SageMaker
    3. Add 4 requests with the following parameters:
        * Request 1
            * Region: US East (Northern Virginia)
            * Resource Type: SageMaker Training
            * Limit: ml.c5.18xlarge instances
            * New limit value: 5 
        * Request 2
            * Region: US East (Northern Virginia)
            * Resource Type: SageMaker Training
            * Limit: Number of Instances for a Training Job
            * New limit value: 5
        * Request 3
            * Region: US East (Northern Virginia)
            * Resource Type: SageMaker Hosting
            * Limit: ml.t2.medium
            * New limit value: 5
        * Request 3
            * Region: US East (Northern Virginia)
            * Resource Type: SageMaker Hosting
            * Limit: Number of Instances for an Endpoint
            * New limit value: 5
    4. In "Case description", enter "We have an application that train models and generate endpoints automatically from UI. The current limit is too low for usage."
    5. In "Contact options", choose your preferred option
    6. Click the orange "Submit" button
2. Install Docker (tested on Docker Desktop version 2.1.0.5). This is required for SAM.
3. Install SAM CLI in your local machine. The installation steps are in [this link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html). If you have never used SAM before, it is recommended to go through "Tutorial: Deploying a Hello World Application" section. It should take about 10 minutes to finish. 
4. Install Python version 3.7.6 
5. Install NodeJS version 10.20.1 


# Deployment Steps

1. Create a Sagemaker notebook instance (this will be used to create the docker) with required permissions by running:
    ```shell script
    cd machine-learning
    ./deploy_ml_container.sh
    ```
    * A Jypyter notebook instance is created with the name "Notebook". To access this, go to your AWS console, and then select Sagemaker service and click on "Notebook Instances" on the left .
    * You should see a notebook called unzip.ipynb inside this notebook session. 
    * Copy the "container_hpo.zip" file from your computer to "Notebook" workspace (same directory where unzip.ipynb exists) by clicking the upload button on top right of the notebook session.
    * Once you uploaded the zip file, run the code in unzip.ipynb to unzip the folder if you are asked to choose a kernel, you can choose "conda_python3". Once you unzipped the folder, go inside "container_hpo" folder and open "Build Container.ipynb" notebook.
    * You only need to run the following section in this notebook: "Building and registering the container". The rest is for local testing and traspacency. 
    * If this section runs successfully, that means you built and pushed the container to ECR. You should see a message like following if everything is successfull:

        latest: digest: sha256:b50f8f8218f402aba9c6c73b528079fa0bbb77574947c59d6f9a0bce0071e5cf size: 3268
    
2. Install `shared-infra` by running
    ```shell script
    cd shared-infra
    ./deploy-infra.sh app-name-infr
    ```
    
    This will deploy a CloudFormation stack called "app-name-infr". You can check it in [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1)
    
    The script will print Deployment Bucket and Training Bucket. Copy these two values for the next steps.
3. Install `backend` by running
    ```shell script
    cd ../backend/training-pipeline
    ./deploy-training-pipeline.sh app-name-backend TRAINING_BUCKET_NAME_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP DEPLOYMENT_BUCKET_NAME_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP
    ```
    
    This will build and deploy a CloudFormation stack called "app-name-backend". You can check it in [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1)

4. Install `frontend` by running
    ```shell script
    cd ../../frontend/webapp 
    # The first time you run this could take up to 30 minutes. 
    ./deploy-webapp.sh app-name-webapp app-name-backend DEPLOYMENT_BUCKET_NAME_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP us-east-1
    ```
    
    This will deploy AWS S3 and CloudFront distribution to host the website, retrieve configuration from `backend`, build the frontend asset, and upload it to S3 for hosting.
    
    The script will print a URL for accessing the website.

5. Create a new user for the application:
    * Go to [Cognito console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/home?region=us-east-1#)
    * Change the region if you are not using N. Virginia (us-east-1)
    * Click "Manage User Pool"
    * Click "app-name-backend"
    * On the left hand menu bar, click "Users and groups"
    * Click "Create user"
    * Enter "Username" and "Temporary password"
    * Enter "Email"
    * Uncheck 
        * "Send an invitation to this new users?"
        * "Mark phone number as verified"
    * Click "Create user"
    * Go to the website URL (from the last step) and login with the Username and Password.
